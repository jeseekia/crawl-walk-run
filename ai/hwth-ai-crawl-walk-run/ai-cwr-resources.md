## Algorithms
- Based on prob stats?
- Different types of problems have tuned Algorithms
| Problem | Strategy | Parameters and Return Type |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Predict continuous values | Linear Regression | P: feature data, training rate R: label |
| Image Recognition | ??? | ??? |
| ??? | ??? | ??? |


Skills matrix (could add math, science, other discipline headings)
| Layer | Skills Needed |
| AI training services | Problem solving |
| Using pre-trained models or "partial training" | Programming fundamentals |
| Standard "training strategies" | Programming |
| "Curated" training | Prob Stats |
